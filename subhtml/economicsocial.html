Moreover, VR technology is also largely applicable in conferencing and remote work. Not only does it eliminate the physical distance, it also improves convenience, mobility, and participation.</p>

Moreover, users can view the product prior to any purchasing decisions. For instance, Volvo AB created <a href="https://www.volvocars.com/us/about/our-points-of-pride/google-cardboard">Volvo Reality</a>, a mobile phone application which enabled users to test drive their new SUV, the XC90, using a smartphone and a Google Cardboard.</p>

            <p class="lead">In the pursuit of localization, Starbucks Japan and its designers attempted to craft a unique design of its coffee houses to cater to local consumers’ preference. Starbucks began to create VR contents for their shops using Building Information Modeling (BIM) data since 2016. Data such as the furnishings of the stores are then converted to VR content. The designers then produced a concept store in VR. The baristas were then invited to view the store and to provide critical feedback using HTC Vive’s HMD. Through the feedbacks, the designers could refine the store designs accordingly for their coworkers, and this facilitated the efficiency of workflow.

            <p class="lead">Boeing has been utilizing VR within its organization to help improve training efficiencies, reduce design errors, and speed up maintenance processes. With regards to training efficiencies, the organization is dedicated to making it more intuitive by enhancing the collaborations between engineers in the virtual space. As for designing aircrafts, the business can eliminate the cost of producing full-scale prototype by creating virtual prototypes.</p>

            <p class="lead">In such virtual space, designers can explore a mock-up of an entire aircraft, and they can eliminate potential issues quickly. For example, if a vital gauge or access point be blocked by paneling, it can be easily adapted in a VR design within hours, instead of taking weeks by changing the prototype and testing the new processes. Furthermore, prospective aircraft buyers can use the program “Ramsis” to inspect the plane prior to making the purchase.

The information within these devices are then monitored, collected, and analyzed. These devices range from smart microwaves to wearable fitness devices, and even autonomous vehicles. With the addition of VR headsets, this opens up the possibility for users to have full command and control centers without the need to purchase multiple huge displays for the information feed. Moreover, these centers are also readily available anywhere.</p>

In a recent survey done by Nielsen, the indication was that the knowledge of VR technology is steadily becoming mainstream. The increase in consumer awareness is reflected in growth estimates for VR with an estimated 150 million units of VR headsets are expected to ship by 2025.</p>

However, it is possible that the high prices of existing VR sets may only be affordable for consumers aged 25-39, as younger consumers may not have the purchasing power to afford the requisite equipment. </p>

            <p class="lead">The actual data gleaned from the survey supports a hypothesis that there is in fact an age skew amongst VR users. Consumers in the age range of 25-39 would in effect be in their most active life stages – characterised with the highest levels of the presence of children, full-time employment and relatively high household income as compared to consumers outside of this age group. These cumulative sociological factors do correlate strongly with higher demand for consumer goods and behaviours such as home entertainment, game consoles, game-playing, and gaming desktops and notebooks.</p>

            <p class="lead">There are tremendous potentials for the advent of VR to change the landscape of social activities. Currently, due to VR headset’s high price point, the outreach by VR is limited. This places restrictions on the efficacy of social applications like <a href="https://www.vrchat.net/">VRChat</a>. However, with VR equipment set to be priced more affordably, performing social activities in VR could be as easy and ubiquitous as Facebook, Instagram and Whatsapp are today. Facebook has given us some insight on the potential of VR with their social VR app. It enables users to feel as though they are in the same virtual space with their contacts and engage in ‘Facebook activities’ together such as playing poker. It was created with the aim of building the most ‘natural’ social media platform available.</p>

            <p class="lead">One of the upsides of such location-based entertainment is that consumers are not required to purchase their own headsets, but they can access the entertainment as they would with a 4D cinema, where visitors use the provided headsets for the immersive experience.
