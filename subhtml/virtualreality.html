Companies such as Sega and Nintendo have also attempted to produce consoles that supported VR as home entertainment systems. These machines were known as “Genesis” and “Virtual Boy” respectively. “Genesis” did not move past the prototype phase due to potential medical issues that surfaced with its usage, while the release of “Virtual Boy” in 1995 was a commercial flop due to the lack of technological capability to support VR during that era. </p>

            <p class="lead">When the user tilts their head, the receiver at the back of the user’s head notices the change in position. These sensors typically include a gyroscope, accelerometer, magnetometer, and the information recorded by these individual components are quickly pieced together. The feedback is then sent to the graphics workstation, and the computer will utilize the new positional data to compute a new viewing direction of the virtual image. Then, it renders the refreshed image for the user.</p>

            <p class="lead">Another major component of VR is the speaker, and the most significant development in VR sound is “spatial audio”. The orientation tracker provides the data for the computer to colocate sound sources with the virtual object the user sees in VR. Thus, if an object drops behind the user, they will be able to look back as spatial audio enables the sounds emitted by the VR system to each ear to vary. Moreover, if the virtual character talking to the user is standing on his/her left, the user’s left ear will pick up more voice and the right ear will hear less. This soundscape can then facilitate an immersive VR experience for the user. </p>
